            comfortable
            ‘home away from home’ environment. Edenhall is conveniently located and is within walking distance of CIT,
            while
            also being on a central bus route to UCC. We aim to provide a comfortable, safe and secure environment at
            all
            times. All of our rooms are en-suite and the apartments come fully furnished, making it perfect for students
            to
            share but still enjoy their own space.

        <p>“I think EdenHall is a fantastic place to live during your college year as it has all the amenities any
            student could wish to have at their front door; a fabulous bar and restaurant… it is 5 minutes from CIT and
            has regular bus routes to UCC and the city centre just outside its gates. Not to mention the fact that the
            apartments are fully equipped and have spacious and comfortable kitchen and living areas, en suite bedrooms
            and 24/7 security. It offers a great opportunity to meet new people and to really make your college year a
            wonderful and exciting experience. I am delighted I chose EdenHall and I will definitely recommend it to
            anyone coming to college in Cork in the future.”
